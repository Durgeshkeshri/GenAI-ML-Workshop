# Generative AI Workshop

## 1. Introduction to AI & Generative AI
### What is AI?
- Definition of Artificial Intelligence  
- Real-world applications of AI  

### AI Vs ML Vs DS Vs DL Vs NLP
- Understanding the differences between AI, Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing  
- Examples and overlaps in real-world scenarios  

### What is Generative AI?
- Overview of Generative AI and how it differs from traditional AI  
- Key Applications: Text, Images, Music, and More  
- Impact of Generative AI on industries (e.g., content creation, healthcare, art)  

### Types of Generative Models
- Overview of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformers  
- Key differences and how they are applied in Generative AI  
- Case studies for each model (e.g., image generation with GANs, text generation with Transformers)

### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
A **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** is a system with two parts: one creates fake data, and the other tries to tell if it’s real or fake. They compete with each other, helping the system get better at creating realistic data, like images.

### Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
A **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** is a system that learns to simplify data into a smaller form and then recreate it. This allows it to generate new, similar data, like creating new images based on patterns it has learned.

### Transformers
**Transformers** are a type of model that helps computers understand and generate language by focusing on important parts of a sentence, no matter their position. They are great at handling large amounts of text and are used in tasks like translation, summarization, and chatbots.
